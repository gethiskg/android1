    <string name="desc">I’ve spent the last weekend in Provincetown, Massachusetts, the gayest,
        most charming little Cape Cod beach town in the world.
        (Think Cabot Cove from Murder, She Wrote, except everyone is Angela Lansbury.)
        On Saturday, the day after Taylor Swift released “You Need To Calm Down,” I bumped into
        Jeremy Blacklow, the Director of Entertainment Media at GLAAD, the media-monitoring organization
        she name-checks in the song. I asked how that experience had been for GLAAD,
        and Jeremy looked me right in the eyes and said, "AMAZING." Taylor made a big donation just a few weeks ago in anticipation of “Calm Down,”
        and in the wake of the songs lyric video,
        $13 donations to the non profit 13 being Taylor Swifts favorite numberhave come pouring in.
